        <h4>History of the school, who started it and what it offers.</h4>
        <p>
          The College is named after the founding father of the African work of
          the Assemblies of God in South Africa, namely, Nicholas Bhengu. He
          conceived the idea of a Bible School as early as 1963, when he
          challenged believers in Transkei, to give towards the building of a
          Bible School. In 1966 he spoke to the late Bill Kirby, a British
          Assemblies of God Missionary, to go for training so that he would
          start the School. Kirby studied at London Bible College and returned
          to South Africa in 1969. However, the School did not begin until long
          after Nicholas Bhengu had passed on. Kirby went to Swaziland at the
          invitation of Dr Lukhele & others in that country, to open a Bible
          School in 1991. The School later moved to Ladysmith in 1992; and again
          moved to Henley on Klip in 1994. The College now occupies some of the
          premises of the Assemblies of God Centre, at 1922 Regatta Road, Henley
          on Klip; near Meyerton in the Midvaal area of Gauteng. The College
          exists to train aspirant ministers of the Assemblies of God; and any
          other person interested in and hungry for the enriching study of the
          Word of God; and those wishing to prepare themselves for work of the
          Ministry in whatever form.
